## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.1] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed

- **Config Loading Issue** - Fixed template configuration not loading in production environments
  - Added fallback config loading directly from package config file
  - Resolves "No templates found" error when running `wp acorn sage-native-block:create`
  - Templates now load correctly even if Laravel config() helper fails
  - Improved resilience for production WordPress/Acorn environments

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-14

### Changed - BREAKING CHANGES

- **Command renamed** - `sage-native-block:add-setup` is now `sage-native-block:create`
  - More intuitive naming that better reflects the command's purpose
  - Old command still works with deprecation warning for backward compatibility
  - Please update scripts to use the new command name

### Added

- **Fully Interactive Mode** - Command now prompts for all inputs when run without arguments
  - Interactive block name prompt with examples
  - Interactive vendor prefix prompt with default option
  - Visual welcome message and guided flow
  - Much improved user experience for developers creating blocks
- **Smart Input Handling** - Command adapts based on provided arguments
  - No arguments: Fully interactive mode
  - Block name only: Prompts for template selection
  - All arguments: Non-interactive automation mode

### Changed

- **Improved Command Output** - Redesigned terminal UI for better readability and user experience
  - Added visual separators (━) and section headers (Setup/Files) for clear organization
  - Replaced verbose messages with clean check marks (✓) and error marks (✗)
  - Grouped related file operations (e.g., "block.json, index.js") instead of per-file output
  - Changed from absolute paths to relative paths for cleaner, more readable output
  - Added color-coded output: cyan for block names, yellow for sections, green for success
  - Consolidated "already exists" warnings into simple status indicators
  - Simplified confirmation prompt from verbose paragraph to concise "Continue?"
  - Added emoji header (🔨) for visual identification
  - Final success message clearly shows block location with relative path

### Improved

- Better onboarding experience for new users
- Clearer command description emphasizing interactive workflow
- Updated documentation showcasing interactive-first approach
- Maintained backward compatibility for automation via CLI arguments
- Command output is now ~80% less verbose while maintaining all necessary information
- Better visual hierarchy makes it easier to scan command progress at a glance
- Consistent styling whether setup already exists or is being created fresh
- Professional, modern terminal UI that matches industry standards for CLI tools
- **Hierarchical Template Selection** - Two-step template selection process for better organization
  - Step 1: Choose template category (Basic Block, Generic Templates, or Theme-specific templates)
  - Step 2: Select specific template within chosen category
  - Improved user experience with logical grouping of related templates
  - Categories are presented with clear descriptions to guide selection
- **Dynamic Theme Detection** - Template categories intelligently detect themes
  - **Auto-detection for users**: Scans your Sage theme's `stubs/themes/` directory automatically
  - **Config-based for package**: Package templates (like Nynaeve) must be explicitly defined in config
  - Any new theme folder added to your Sage theme automatically appears as a category option
  - Package developers must register themes in config to prevent accidental exposure of incomplete templates
  - Theme stub files are checked in theme first, then package (allows overriding)
  - Theme names are automatically formatted for display (e.g., "Nynaeve Theme - Production templates from Nynaeve theme")
- **Template Configuration** - Added `category` field to all template definitions
  - Templates now organized by category: `basic`, `generic`, or theme name
  - Simplified template names as they're now grouped by category
  - Example: "InnerBlocks Container (Generic)" is now just "InnerBlocks Container" under Generic Templates
- **Interactive Flow Enhancement** - Basic block selection is now streamlined
  - Selecting "Basic Block" category immediately uses the basic template without additional prompts
  - Generic and theme categories show template options for user selection
- **Custom Template Support** - Users can now add custom block templates without modifying vendor package
  - Create templates in your Sage theme's `block-templates/` directory
  - Templates are automatically detected and available in the template selection menu
  - No configuration file needed - just drop your template files and they appear
  - Override package templates by creating a template with the same name in your theme
- **Template Metadata** - Optional `template-meta.json` for rich template descriptions
  - Define custom name, description, and category for your templates
  - Falls back to auto-generated values from folder name if metadata not provided
  - Schema: `{ "name": "...", "description": "...", "category": "..." }`
  - Metadata file is completely optional - templates work without it
- **Smart Template Discovery** - Automatic template detection from both package and theme
  - Scans theme's `block-templates/` directory for any folder containing `block.json`
  - Merges theme templates with package templates
  - Theme templates take precedence over package templates with same name
  - Templates organized by category in selection menu
  - Custom templates show "(Custom)" indicator in selection menu for clear differentiation
- **Developer Notes**:
  - **For theme developers**: Use `block-templates/` directory in your Sage theme root
  - **For package developers**: Continue using `stubs/` with config definitions
  - Theme templates can override package templates (checked first)
  - Template name = folder name (use kebab-case for consistency)
  - Folder names automatically converted to human-readable format (e.g., "my-hero" → "My Hero")
  - Non-interactive mode with `--template` flag continues to work as before for automation

### Migration Guide

**Command Name Change:**

The old command still works but shows a deprecation warning:
```shell
# Old command (deprecated but still works)
wp acorn sage-native-block:add-setup my-block --template=cta --force
# Shows: ⚠️ DEPRECATION WARNING - Please use sage-native-block:create instead

# New command (recommended)
wp acorn sage-native-block:create my-block --template=cta --force
```

**Custom Templates:**

Users can now create custom templates in their theme:
```bash
# Create template folder in your theme
mkdir -p block-templates/my-hero
# Add your template files (block.json, editor.jsx, save.jsx, etc.)

# Optional: Add metadata for better display
echo '{"name":"Hero Section","description":"Custom hero template","category":"custom"}' > block-templates/my-hero/template-meta.json
```

Templates automatically appear in the category selection menu on next run.
