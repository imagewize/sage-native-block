## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-14

### Changed - BREAKING CHANGES

- **Command renamed** - `sage-native-block:add-setup` is now `sage-native-block:create`
  - More intuitive naming that better reflects the command's purpose
  - Old command still works with deprecation warning for backward compatibility
  - Please update scripts to use the new command name

### Added

- **Fully Interactive Mode** - Command now prompts for all inputs when run without arguments
  - Interactive block name prompt with examples
  - Interactive vendor prefix prompt with default option
  - Visual welcome message and guided flow
  - Much improved user experience for developers creating blocks
- **Smart Input Handling** - Command adapts based on provided arguments
  - No arguments: Fully interactive mode
  - Block name only: Prompts for template selection
  - All arguments: Non-interactive automation mode

### Changed

- **Improved Command Output** - Redesigned terminal UI for better readability and user experience
  - Added visual separators (‚îÅ) and section headers (Setup/Files) for clear organization
  - Replaced verbose messages with clean check marks (‚úì) and error marks (‚úó)
  - Grouped related file operations (e.g., "block.json, index.js") instead of per-file output
  - Changed from absolute paths to relative paths for cleaner, more readable output
  - Added color-coded output: cyan for block names, yellow for sections, green for success
  - Consolidated "already exists" warnings into simple status indicators
  - Simplified confirmation prompt from verbose paragraph to concise "Continue?"
  - Added emoji header (üî®) for visual identification
  - Final success message clearly shows block location with relative path

### Improved

- Better onboarding experience for new users
- Clearer command description emphasizing interactive workflow
- Updated documentation showcasing interactive-first approach
- Maintained backward compatibility for automation via CLI arguments
- Command output is now ~80% less verbose while maintaining all necessary information
- Better visual hierarchy makes it easier to scan command progress at a glance
- Consistent styling whether setup already exists or is being created fresh
- Professional, modern terminal UI that matches industry standards for CLI tools
- **Hierarchical Template Selection** - Two-step template selection process for better organization
  - Step 1: Choose template category (Basic Block, Generic Templates, or Theme-specific templates)
  - Step 2: Select specific template within chosen category
  - Improved user experience with logical grouping of related templates
  - Categories are presented with clear descriptions to guide selection
- **Dynamic Theme Detection** - Template categories now automatically detect themes
  - System scans `stubs/themes/` directory for available theme folders
  - Any new theme added to `stubs/themes/` automatically appears as a category option
  - No code changes needed to add new theme template categories
  - Theme names are automatically formatted for display (e.g., "Nynaeve Theme - Production templates from Nynaeve theme")
- **Template Configuration** - Added `category` field to all template definitions
  - Templates now organized by category: `basic`, `generic`, or theme name
  - Simplified template names as they're now grouped by category
  - Example: "InnerBlocks Container (Generic)" is now just "InnerBlocks Container" under Generic Templates
- **Interactive Flow Enhancement** - Basic block selection is now streamlined
  - Selecting "Basic Block" category immediately uses the basic template without additional prompts
  - Generic and theme categories show template options for user selection
- **Developer Notes** - To add a new theme's templates: Create folder `stubs/themes/your-theme-name/` and add templates to config with `'category' => 'your-theme-name'`
  - The system will automatically detect and display the new theme category
  - Non-interactive mode with `--template` flag continues to work as before for automation

### Migration Guide

The old command still works but shows a deprecation warning:
```shell
# Old command (deprecated but still works)
wp acorn sage-native-block:add-setup my-block --template=cta --force
# Shows: ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATION WARNING - Please use sage-native-block:create instead

# New command (recommended)
wp acorn sage-native-block:create my-block --template=cta --force
```
